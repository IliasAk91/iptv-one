<h1>Privacy Policy – IPTV One</h1>

<h2>Data Collection</h2>

IPTV One does not collect personal information, usage data, analytics,

<h2>Data Storage</h2>
<p>
IPTV One uses iCloud to sync your playlists, profiles, favorites, and preferences across your devices. This data is stored securely in your personal iCloud account and is not accessible to the developer. All data synced through iCloud remains under your control and can be managed through your iCloud settings.
</p>

<h2>Content</h2>

IPTV One does not provide, host, or distribute any media content.
All playlists, media sources, and streams are added and managed locally
by the user on their own device.

No user accounts or registrations are required. IPTV One uses your Apple ID for iCloud sync, which is managed entirely by Apple.

IPTV One offers optional premium subscriptions through Apple's in-app purchase system. Payment processing is handled entirely by Apple, and we do not have access to your payment information, billing details, or credit card information. Subscription status is managed by Apple and synced across your devices through your Apple ID.
</p>

<h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
